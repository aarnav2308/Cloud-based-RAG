🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using cloud infrastructure, vector databases, and local large language models.

The system retrieves relevant information from domain-specific documents using semantic search and generates accurate, grounded responses using a locally hosted LLM. The architecture mirrors real-world production RAG systems used in enterprise AI applications.
